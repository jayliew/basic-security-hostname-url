# What is this?

A Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browser extension that performs some basic rudimentary security checks on URLs visited by native-English speakers.

# What does it do?

1. Check if the domain name in the URL contains a hidden non-ASCII character. This is common in phishing and malicious links. [Example](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14119713)

2. Check if the domain name in the URL is obfuscated in such a way that leads to a malicious link, using the new TLDs .zip and .mov [Example](https://medium.com/@bobbyrsec/the-dangers-of-googles-zip-tld-5e1e675e59a5)
